# Hack Slack
Victoria Guido

The next evolution of our Chatbot, Hopper. This gets everyone introduced and used to ChatOps and is an easy way to write some code. Good for newbies and oldies!
Ideas for what we could work on
Developing a naming convention for channels
Developing other 'rules for behavior' on slack - i.e. using the @channel sparingly, etc.
Developing new scripts for things like regularly posting links from confluence, etc
