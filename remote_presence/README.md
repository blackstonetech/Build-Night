Build our own holographic telepresence projector. Allow remote participants to join meetings (including future build nights!) as a 3D projected face. 

# What problem does this solve?
Strike a blow against DC traffic. Establish BTG as a leader in remote collaboration, at a time when remote collaboration is an increasing part of every fed and every developers' life.

# How can we do it?
Pepper's Ghost is an 18th century optical illusion which projects a lighted image into 3D. Our solutions would be a plastic pyramid or cone atop an ipad or horizontal monitor. The OWL camera/mic and Adobe connect provide the bulk of the remote connectivity; we would experiment with seperate bands (skype, for example) that would allow video of a remote attendee to be projected through the horizontal monitor and into the 3D Pepper's Ghost image.

# Cool factor
Seriously - 3D holograms. Floating heads. Imagine the videos!

# Segue
Combine with ALL POSSIBLE build night ideas by using remote presence in future Build Nights.
