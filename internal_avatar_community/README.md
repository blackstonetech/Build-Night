# Build Night: Internal Avatar Community

### POC: Sunday Wiley

### Idea
An avatar community is a fun way to socially engineer high levels of performance

### Value (What does this solve?)
Extrinsic motivation for BTG teams to engage in activities outside of their comfort zones

### How?
Create old school pixel or new age avatars for each employee and give them bling based on what they participate in. 
Avatars can be printed and put on buttons, icons, and used for social media

### Cool Factor / Sexy? 
This will generate rewards and spawn challenges which align with BTG values and mission

### How can your idea segue into other ideas?
As gamefication is an important part of transformation at BTG this project can be used to spawn client-facing gamefied transformations.
