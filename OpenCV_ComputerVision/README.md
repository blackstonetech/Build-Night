- Use RP and camera module to detect what brand of coffee is being brewed by using CV to detect what bag is picked up (Probably neds to be broken into multiple points)

## Value: Value and Vision
- Intro to AI 
- Always know what brand is being brewed
- keep metrics on coffee brands
- Know who made the coffee

## How
- Setup RP: and camera + OpenCV
- train AI to look for different brands of coffee
- write sexy code
- build hardware to display results.

## Cool Factor
- Cuz Kyle is running it
- Learning opening CV
- taking cool pictures
- Intro to AI

## Segue
- More AI
