## Build Night Wednesday 01/25/2017 5pm

Come join us in an attempt to hack together an Internet of Things experiment!!!

### Objective:
  Monitor the state of the Office Coffee Maker:
* report on the amount of coffee in the pot
* report on when the pot was brewed
* report on the strength of the coffee in the pot
* other stretch goals like temperature of the coffee

### In the Tool Belt:
* Arduino based Feather microcomputers with WiFi
* Various Sensors
* Rasberry Pi
* 32x32 "pixel" display panels

Teams will work on different aspects of the project such as teams coding and testing sensors, team coding storage of data, team managing retrieval and display of data.
